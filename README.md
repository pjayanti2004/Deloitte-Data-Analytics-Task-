# Deloitte Data Analytics Task (Forage)

This repository contains my submission for the Data Analytics virtual experience task provided by Deloitte.

## Project Goal
The main goal of this task was to analyze a given employee dataset to perform data classification based on specific business rules.

## What I Did
* Analyzed the provided employee data, focusing on the "Equality Score".
* Used **Microsoft Excel** to clean and process the data.
* Developed a nested **IF formula** combined with the **`ABS` function** to correctly classify each employee into different "Equality Classes" (like 'Highly Discriminative', 'Unfair', or 'Fair').
* This project demonstrates my practical skills in data classification and formula-based data manipulation in Excel.

## Tools Used
* Microsoft Excel
* Advanced Excel Formulas (IF, Nested IF, ABS)
